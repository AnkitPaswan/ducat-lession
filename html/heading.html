<!-- The HTML heading tag is used to define the headings of a page. 
    There are six levels of headings defined by HTML.
     These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6;
      with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

<h1> is used for the main heading. (Biggest in size)
<h2> is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under
     the subheadings then the <h3> elements are used. 
<h6> for the small heading (smallest one). -->
